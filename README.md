Phase 1 project using Studio Ghibli API

## Functionality
The user can view a list of all Studion Ghibli movies, and see more details of a movie if selected. They can mark weither they have watched a movie from the list, and filter the list's view to show the movies that have been marked as watched or not. They can also use the filter to sort the list based on director, run time, or others. 

## Roadmap
Add a searchbar that the user can sort the list based on containing or pertaining to search results keyword(s). 
Add a favorite rating and be able to sort based numerically.
